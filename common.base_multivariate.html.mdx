description: The `BaseWindows` class contains standard methods shared across window-based
  multivariate neural networks; in contrast to recurrent neural networks these models
  commit to a fixed sequence length input.

The standard methods include data preprocessing `_normalization`,
optimization utilities like parameter initialization, `training_step`,
`validation_step`, and shared `fit` and `predict` methods.These shared
methods enable all the `neuralforecast.models` compatibility with the
`core.NeuralForecast` wrapper class.

Base Multivariate

Base class for all multivariate models. The forecasts for all
time-series are produced simultaneously within each window, which are
randomly sampled during training.

This class implements the basic functionality for all windows-based
models, including: - PyTorch Lightning’s methods training_step,
validation_step, predict_step.<br/> - fit and predict methods used by
NeuralForecast.core class.<br/> - sampling and wrangling methods to
generate multivariate windows.
