Transfer learning refers to the process of pre-training a flexible model
on a large dataset and using it later on other data with little to no
training. It is one of the most outstanding ðŸš€ achievements in Machine
Learning ðŸ§  and has many practical applications.

For time series forecasting, the technique allows you to get
lightning-fast predictions âš¡ bypassing the tradeoff between accuracy
and speed (more than 30 times faster than our alreadsy fast
[autoARIMA](https://github.com/Nixtla/statsforecast) for a similar
accuracy).

This notebook shows how to generate a pre-trained model and store it in
a checkpoint to make it available to forecast new time series never seen
by the model.

## 1. Installing Libraries

```python
# %%capture
# !pip install git+https://github.com/Nixtla/datasetsforecast.git@main
```


```python
# %%capture
# !pip install neuralforecast
```


```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import torch
from IPython.display import display, Markdown

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from datasetsforecast.m4 import M4
from neuralforecast.core import NeuralForecast
from neuralforecast.models import NHITS
from neuralforecast.utils import AirPassengersDF
from neuralforecast.losses.numpy import mae, mse
```


```python
import logging
logging.getLogger("pytorch_lightning").setLevel(logging.WARNING)
```

This example will automatically run on GPUs if available. **Make sure**
cuda is available. (If you need help to put this into production send us
an email or join or community, we also offer a fully hosted solution)

```python
torch.cuda.is_available()
```

## 2. Load M4 Data

The `M4` class will automatically download the complete M4 dataset and
process it.

It return three Dataframes: `Y_df` contains the values for the target
variables, `X_df` contains exogenous calendar features and `S_df`
contains static features for each time-series (none for M4). For this
example we will only use `Y_df`.

If you want to use your own data just replace `Y_df`. Be sure to use a
long format and have a simmilar structure than our data set.

```python
Y_df, _, _ = M4.load(directory='./', group='Monthly', cache=True)
Y_df['ds'] = pd.to_datetime(Y_df['ds'])
Y_df
```

## 3. Model Train and Save

Using the
[`NeuralForecast.fit`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/core.html#neuralforecast.fit)
method you can train a set of models to your dataset. You just have to
define the `input_size` and `horizon` of your model. The `input_size` is
the number of historic observations (lags) that the model will use to
learn to predict `h` steps in the future. Also, you can modify the
hyperparameters of the model to get a better accuracy.

```python
horizon = 12
stacks = 3
models = [NHITS(input_size=5 * horizon,
                h=horizon,
                max_steps=100,
                stack_types = stacks*['identity'],
                n_blocks = stacks*[1],
                mlp_units = [[256,256] for _ in range(stacks)],
                n_pool_kernel_size = stacks*[1],
                batch_size = 32,
                scaler_type='standard',
                n_freq_downsample=[12,4,1])]
nf = NeuralForecast(models=models, freq='M')
nf.fit(df=Y_df)
```

Save model with `core.NeuralForecast.save` method. This method uses
PytorchLightning `save_checkpoint` function. We set `save_dataset=False`
to only save the model.

```python
nf.save(path='./results/transfer/', model_index=None, overwrite=True, save_dataset=False)
```

## 4. Transfer M4 to AirPassengers

We load the stored model with the `core.NeuralForecast.load` method, and
forecast `AirPassenger` with the `core.NeuralForecast.predict` function.

```python
fcst2 = NeuralForecast.load(path='./results/transfer/')
```


```python
# We define the train df. 
Y_df = AirPassengersDF.copy()
mean = Y_df[Y_df.ds<='1959-12-31']['y'].mean()
std = Y_df[Y_df.ds<='1959-12-31']['y'].std()

Y_train_df = Y_df[Y_df.ds<='1959-12-31'] # 132 train
Y_test_df = Y_df[Y_df.ds>'1959-12-31']   # 12 test
```


```python
Y_hat_df = fcst2.predict(df=Y_train_df).reset_index()
Y_hat_df.head()
```


```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize = (20, 7))
Y_hat_df = Y_test_df.merge(Y_hat_df, how='left', on=['unique_id', 'ds'])
plot_df = pd.concat([Y_train_df, Y_hat_df]).set_index('ds')

plot_df[['y', 'NHITS']].plot(ax=ax, linewidth=2)

ax.set_title('AirPassengers Forecast', fontsize=22)
ax.set_ylabel('Monthly Passengers', fontsize=20)
ax.set_xlabel('Timestamp [t]', fontsize=20)
ax.legend(prop={'size': 15})
ax.grid()
```

## 5. Evaluate Results

We evaluate the forecasts of the pre-trained model with the Mean
Absolute Error
([`mae`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/losses.numpy.html#mae)).

$$

\qquad MAE = \frac{1}{Horizon} \sum_{\tau} |y_{\tau} - \hat{y}_{\tau}|\qquad

$$

```python
y_true = Y_test_df.y.values
y_hat = Y_hat_df['NHITS'].values
```


```python
print('NHITS     MAE: %0.3f' % mae(y_hat, y_true))
print('ETS       MAE: 16.222')
print('AutoARIMA MAE: 18.551')
```
