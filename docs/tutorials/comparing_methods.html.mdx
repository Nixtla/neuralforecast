Statistical, Machine Learning, and Neural Forecasting Methods In this
tutorial, we will explore the process of forecasting on the M5 dataset
by utilizing the most suitable model for each time series. We’ll
accomplish this through an essential technique known as
cross-validation. This approach helps us in estimating the predictive
performance of our models, and in selecting the model that yields the
best performance for each time series.

The M5 dataset comprises of hierarchical sales data, spanning five
years, from Walmart. The aim is to forecast daily sales for the next 28
days. The dataset is broken down into the 50 states of America, with 10
stores in each state.

In the realm of time series forecasting and analysis, one of the more
complex tasks is identifying the model that is optimally suited for a
specific group of series. Quite often, this selection process leans
heavily on intuition, which may not necessarily align with the empirical
reality of our dataset.

In this tutorial, we aim to provide a more structured, data-driven
approach to model selection for different groups of series within the M5
benchmark dataset. This dataset, well-known in the field of forecasting,
allows us to showcase the versatility and power of our methodology.

We will train an assortment of models from various forecasting
paradigms:

*[StatsForecast]((https://github.com/Nixtla/statsforecast))*

-   Baseline models: These models are simple yet often highly effective
    for providing an initial perspective on the forecasting problem. We
    will use `SeasonalNaive` and `HistoricAverage` models for this
    category.
-   Intermittent models: For series with sporadic, non-continuous
    demand, we will utilize models like `CrostonOptimized`, `IMAPA`, and
    `ADIDA`. These models are particularly suited for handling
    zero-inflated series.
-   State Space Models: These are statistical models that use
    mathematical descriptions of a system to make predictions. The
    `AutoETS` model from the statsforecast library falls under this
    category.

*[MLForecast](https://github.com/Nixtla/mlforecast)*

Machine Learning: Leveraging ML models like `LightGBM`, `XGBoost`, and
`LinearRegression` can be advantageous due to their capacity to uncover
intricate patterns in data. We’ll use the MLForecast library for this
purpose.

*[NeuralForecast](https://github.com/Nixtla/neuralforecast)*

Deep Learning: DL models, such as Transformers (`AutoTFT`) and Neural
Networks (`AutoNHITS`), allow us to handle complex non-linear
dependencies in time series data. We’ll utilize the NeuralForecast
library for these models.

Using the Nixtla suite of libraries, we’ll be able to drive our model
selection process with data, ensuring we utilize the most suitable
models for specific groups of series in our dataset.

Outline:

-   Reading Data: In this initial step, we load our dataset into memory,
    making it available for our subsequent analysis and forecasting. It
    is important to understand the structure and nuances of the dataset
    at this stage.

-   Forecasting Using Statistical and Deep Learning Methods: We apply a
    wide range of forecasting methods from basic statistical techniques
    to advanced deep learning models. The aim is to generate predictions
    for the next 28 days based on our dataset.

-   Model Performance Evaluation on Different Windows: We assess the
    performance of our models on distinct windows.

-   Selecting the Best Model for a Group of Series: Using the
    performance evaluation, we identify the optimal model for each group
    of series. This step ensures that the chosen model is tailored to
    the unique characteristics of each group.

-   Filtering the Best Possible Forecast: Finally, we filter the
    forecasts generated by our chosen models to obtain the most
    promising predictions. This is our final output and represents the
    best possible forecast for each series according to our models.

## Installing Libraries

```python
%%capture
!pip install statsforecast mlforecast neuralforecast pyarrow
```

## Download and prepare data

The example uses the [M5
dataset](https://github.com/Mcompetitions/M5-methods/blob/master/M5-Competitors-Guide.pdf).
It consists of `30,490` bottom time series.

```python
import pandas as pd
```


```python
# Load the training target dataset from the provided URL
Y_df = pd.read_parquet('https://m5-benchmarks.s3.amazonaws.com/data/train/target.parquet')

# Rename columns to match the Nixtlaverse's expectations
# The 'item_id' becomes 'unique_id' representing the unique identifier of the time series
# The 'timestamp' becomes 'ds' representing the time stamp of the data points
# The 'demand' becomes 'y' representing the target variable we want to forecast
Y_df = Y_df.rename(
    columns={
        'item_id': 'unique_id', 
        'timestamp': 'ds', 
        'demand': 'y'
    }
)

# Convert the 'ds' column to datetime format to ensure proper handling of date-related operations in subsequent steps
Y_df['ds'] = pd.to_datetime(Y_df['ds'])
```

For simplicity sake we will keep just one category

```python
Y_df = Y_df.query('unique_id.str.startswith("FOODS_3")').reset_index(drop=True)
Y_df['unique_id'] = Y_df['unique_id'].astype(str)
```

# Basic Plotting

Plot some series using the `plot_series` function from the
`utilsforecast` library. This method prints 8 random series from the
dataset and is useful for basic EDA.

```python
from utilsforecast.plotting import plot_series
```


```python
# Feature: plot random series for EDA
plot_series(Y_df)
```

![](comparing_methods_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-9-output-1.png)

```python
# Feature: plot groups of series for EDA
plot_series(Y_df, ids=["FOODS_3_432_TX_2"])
```

# Create forecasts with Stats, Ml and Neural methods.

## StatsForecast

`StatsForecast` is a comprehensive library providing a suite of popular
univariate time series forecasting models, all designed with a focus on
high performance and scalability.

Here’s what makes StatsForecast a powerful tool for time series
forecasting:

-   **Collection of Local Models**: StatsForecast provides a diverse
    collection of local models that can be applied to each time series
    individually, allowing us to capture unique patterns within each
    series.

-   **Simplicity**: With StatsForecast, training, forecasting, and
    backtesting multiple models become a straightforward process,
    requiring only a few lines of code. This simplicity makes it a
    convenient tool for both beginners and experienced practitioners.

-   **Optimized for Speed**: The implementation of the models in
    StatsForecast is optimized for speed, ensuring that large-scale
    computations are performed efficiently, thereby reducing the overall
    time for model training and prediction.

-   **Horizontal Scalability**: One of the distinguishing features of
    StatsForecast is its ability to scale horizontally. It is compatible
    with distributed computing frameworks such as Spark, Dask, and Ray.
    This feature allows it to handle large datasets by distributing the
    computations across multiple nodes in a cluster, making it a go-to
    solution for large-scale time series forecasting tasks.

`StatsForecast` receives a list of models to fit each time series. Since
we are dealing with Daily data, it would be benefitial to use 7 as
seasonality.

```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast
# Import necessary models from the statsforecast library
from statsforecast.models import (
    # SeasonalNaive: A model that uses the previous season's data as the forecast
    SeasonalNaive,
    # Naive: A simple model that uses the last observed value as the forecast
    Naive,
    # HistoricAverage: This model uses the average of all historical data as the forecast
    HistoricAverage,
    # CrostonOptimized: A model specifically designed for intermittent demand forecasting
    CrostonOptimized,
    # ADIDA: Adaptive combination of Intermittent Demand Approaches, a model designed for intermittent demand
    ADIDA,
    # IMAPA: Intermittent Multiplicative AutoRegressive Average, a model for intermittent series that incorporates autocorrelation
    IMAPA,
    # AutoETS: Automated Exponential Smoothing model that automatically selects the best Exponential Smoothing model based on AIC
    AutoETS
)
```

We fit the models by instantiating a new StatsForecast object with the
following parameters:

-   `models`: a list of models. Select the models you want from models
    and import them.
-   `freq`: a string indicating the frequency of the data. (See panda’s
    available frequencies.)
-   `n_jobs`: int, number of jobs used in the parallel processing, use
    -1 for all cores.
-   `fallback_model`: a model to be used if a model fails. Any settings
    are passed into the constructor. Then you call its fit method and
    pass in the historical data frame.

```python
horizon = 28
models = [
    SeasonalNaive(season_length=7),
    Naive(),
    HistoricAverage(),
    CrostonOptimized(),
    ADIDA(),
    IMAPA(),
    AutoETS(season_length=7)
]
```


```python
# Instantiate the StatsForecast class
sf = StatsForecast(
    models=models,  # A list of models to be used for forecasting
    freq='D',  # The frequency of the time series data (in this case, 'D' stands for daily frequency)
    n_jobs=-1,  # The number of CPU cores to use for parallel execution (-1 means use all available cores)
    verbose=True,  # Show progress
)
```

The forecast method produces predictions for the next `h` periods.

The forecast object here is a new data frame that includes a column with
the name of the model and the y hat values.

This block of code times how long it takes to run the forecasting
function of the StatsForecast class, which predicts the next 28 days
(h=28). The time is calculated in minutes and printed out at the end.

```python
from time import time

# Get the current time before forecasting starts, this will be used to measure the execution time
init = time()

# Call the forecast method of the StatsForecast instance to predict the next 28 days (h=28) 
fcst_df = sf.forecast(df=Y_df, h=28)

# Get the current time after the forecasting ends
end = time()

# Calculate and print the total time taken for the forecasting in minutes
print(f'Forecast Minutes: {(end - init) / 60}')
```

``` text

```

``` text
Forecast Minutes: 4.009805858135223
```

```python
fcst_df.head()
```

## MLForecast

`MLForecast` is a powerful library that provides automated feature
creation for time series forecasting, facilitating the use of global
machine learning models. It is designed for high performance and
scalability.

Key features of MLForecast include:

-   **Support for sklearn models**: MLForecast is compatible with models
    that follow the scikit-learn API. This makes it highly flexible and
    allows it to seamlessly integrate with a wide variety of machine
    learning algorithms.

-   **Simplicity**: With MLForecast, the tasks of training, forecasting,
    and backtesting models can be accomplished in just a few lines of
    code. This streamlined simplicity makes it user-friendly for
    practitioners at all levels of expertise.

-   **Optimized for speed:** MLForecast is engineered to execute tasks
    rapidly, which is crucial when handling large datasets and complex
    models.

-   **Horizontal Scalability:** MLForecast is capable of horizontal
    scaling using distributed computing frameworks such as Spark, Dask,
    and Ray. This feature enables it to efficiently process massive
    datasets by distributing the computations across multiple nodes in a
    cluster, making it ideal for large-scale time series forecasting
    tasks.

```python
from mlforecast import MLForecast
from mlforecast.lag_transforms import ExpandingMean
from mlforecast.target_transforms import Differences
from mlforecast.utils import PredictionIntervals
```


```python
%%capture
!pip install lightgbm xgboost
```


```python
# Import the necessary models from various libraries

# LGBMRegressor: A gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms from the LightGBM library
from lightgbm import LGBMRegressor

# XGBRegressor: A gradient boosting regressor model from the XGBoost library
from xgboost import XGBRegressor

# LinearRegression: A simple linear regression model from the scikit-learn library
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

To use `MLForecast` for time series forecasting, we instantiate a new
`MLForecast` object and provide it with various parameters to tailor the
modeling process to our specific needs:

-   `models`: This parameter accepts a list of machine learning models
    you wish to use for forecasting. You can import your preferred
    models from scikit-learn, lightgbm and xgboost.

-   `freq`: This is a string indicating the frequency of your data
    (hourly, daily, weekly, etc.). The specific format of this string
    should align with pandas’ recognized frequency strings.

-   `target_transforms`: These are transformations applied to the target
    variable before model training and after model prediction. This can
    be useful when working with data that may benefit from
    transformations, such as log-transforms for highly skewed data.

-   `lags`: This parameter accepts specific lag values to be used as
    regressors. Lags represent how many steps back in time you want to
    look when creating features for your model. For example, if you want
    to use the previous day’s data as a feature for predicting today’s
    value, you would specify a lag of 1.

-   `lags_transforms`: These are specific transformations for each lag.
    This allows you to apply transformations to your lagged features.

-   `date_features`: This parameter specifies date-related features to
    be used as regressors. For instance, you might want to include the
    day of the week or the month as a feature in your model.

-   `num_threads`: This parameter controls the number of threads to use
    for parallelizing feature creation, helping to speed up this process
    when working with large datasets.

All these settings are passed to the `MLForecast` constructor. Once the
`MLForecast` object is initialized with these settings, we call its
`fit` method and pass the historical data frame as the argument. The
`fit` method trains the models on the provided historical data, readying
them for future forecasting tasks.

```python
# Instantiate the MLForecast object
mlf = MLForecast(
    models=[LGBMRegressor(verbosity=-1), XGBRegressor(), LinearRegression()],  # List of models for forecasting: LightGBM, XGBoost and Linear Regression
    freq='D',  # Frequency of the data - 'D' for daily frequency
    lags=list(range(1, 7)),  # Specific lags to use as regressors: 1 to 6 days
    lag_transforms = {
        1: [ExpandingMean()],  # Apply expanding mean transformation to the lag of 1 day
    },
    date_features=['year', 'month', 'day', 'dayofweek', 'quarter', 'week'],  # Date features to use as regressors
)
```

Just call the `fit` models to train the select models. In this case we
are generating conformal prediction intervals.

```python
# Start the timer to calculate the time taken for fitting the models
init = time()

# Fit the MLForecast models to the data
mlf.fit(Y_df)

# Calculate the end time after fitting the models
end = time()

# Print the time taken to fit the MLForecast models, in minutes
print(f'MLForecast Minutes: {(end - init) / 60}')
```

``` text
MLForecast Minutes: 0.5360581119855244
```

After that, just call `predict` to generate forecasts.

```python
fcst_mlf_df = mlf.predict(28)
```


```python
fcst_mlf_df.head()
```

# Validate Model’s Performance

The three libraries - `StatsForecast`, `MLForecast`, and
`NeuralForecast` - offer out-of-the-box cross-validation capabilities
specifically designed for time series. This allows us to evaluate the
model’s performance using historical data to obtain an unbiased
assessment of how well each model is likely to perform on unseen data.

## Cross Validation in StatsForecast

The `cross_validation` method from the `StatsForecast` class accepts the
following arguments:

-   `df`: A DataFrame representing the training data.
-   `h` (int): The forecast horizon, represented as the number of steps
    into the future that we wish to predict. For example, if we’re
    forecasting hourly data, `h=24` would represent a 24-hour forecast.
-   `step_size` (int): The step size between each cross-validation
    window. This parameter determines how often we want to run the
    forecasting process.
-   `n_windows` (int): The number of windows used for cross validation.
    This parameter defines how many past forecasting processes we want
    to evaluate.

These parameters allow us to control the extent and granularity of our
cross-validation process. By tuning these settings, we can balance
between computational cost and the thoroughness of the cross-validation.

```python
sf.verbose = False
init = time()
cv_df = sf.cross_validation(df=Y_df, h=horizon, n_windows=3, step_size=horizon)
end = time()
print(f'CV Minutes: {(end - init) / 60}')
```

``` text
CV Minutes: 10.829525109132131
```

The crossvaldation_df object is a new data frame that includes the
following columns:

-   `unique_id` series identifier
-   `ds`: datestamp or temporal index
-   `cutoff`: the last datestamp or temporal index for the n_windows. If
    n_windows=1, then one unique cuttoff value, if n_windows=2 then two
    unique cutoff values.
-   `y`: true value
-   `"model"`: columns with the model’s name and fitted value.

```python
cv_df.head()
```

## MLForecast

The `cross_validation` method from the `MLForecast` class takes the
following arguments.

-   `df`: training data frame
-   `h` (int): represents the steps into the future that are being
    forecasted. In this case, 24 hours ahead.
-   `step_size` (int): step size between each window. In other words:
    how often do you want to run the forecasting processes.
-   `n_windows` (int): number of windows used for cross-validation. In
    other words: what number of forecasting processes in the past do you
    want to evaluate.

```python
init = time()
cv_mlf_df = mlf.cross_validation(
    df=Y_df, 
    h=horizon,
    n_windows=3,
)
end = time()
print(f'CV Minutes: {(end - init) / 60}')

### Choose models for groups of series

Feature:

-   A unified dataframe with forecasts for all different models
-   Easy Ensamble
-   E.g. Average predictions
-   Or MinMax (Choosing is ensembling)

```python
# Choose the best model for each time series, metric, and cross validation window
evaluation_df['best_model'] = evaluation_df.idxmin(axis=1, numeric_only=True)
# count how many times a model wins per metric and cross validation window
count_best_model = evaluation_df.groupby(['metric', 'best_model']).size().rename('n').to_frame().reset_index()
# plot results
sns.barplot(count_best_model, x='n', y='best_model', hue='metric')
```

### Et pluribus unum: an inclusive forecasting Pie.

```python
# For the mse, calculate how many times a model wins
eval_series_df = evaluation_df.query('metric == "mse"').groupby(['unique_id']).mean(numeric_only=True)
eval_series_df['best_model'] = eval_series_df.idxmin(axis=1)
