title: Time Series Scaling
---


Scaling time series data is an important preprocessing step when using
neural forecasting methods for several reasons:

1.  **Convergence speed**: Neural forecasting models tend to converge
    faster when the features are on a similar scale.
2.  **Avoiding vanishing or exploding gradients**: some architectures,
    such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are sensitive to the scale
    of input data. If the input values are too large, it could lead to
    exploding gradients, where the gradients become too large and the
    model becomes unstable. Conversely, very small input values could
    lead to vanishing gradients, where weight updates during training
    are negligible and the training fails to converge.
3.  **Ensuring consistent scale**: Neural forecasting models have shared
    global parameters for the all time series of the task. In cases
    where time series have different scale, scaling ensures that no
    particular time series dominates the learning process.
4.  **Improving generalization**: time series with consistent scale can
    lead to smoother loss surfaces. Moreover, scaling helps to
    homogenize the distribution of the input data, which can also
    improve generalization by avoiding out-of-range values.

The `Neuralforecast` library integrates two types of temporal scaling:

-   **Time Series Scaling**: scaling each time series using all its data
    on the train set before start training the model. This is done by
    using the `local_scaler_type` parameter of the `Neuralforecast` core
    class.
-   **Window scaling (TemporalNorm)**: scaling each input window
    separetly for each element of the batch at every training iteration.
    This is done by using the `scaler_type` parameter of each model
    class.

In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to scale the time series data
with both methods on an Eletricity Price Forecasting (EPF) task.

You can run these experiments using GPU with Google Colab.

## 1. Install `Neuralforecast`

```python
!pip install neuralforecast
!pip install hyperopt
```

## 2. Load Data

The `df` dataframe contains the target and exogenous variables past
information to train the model. The `unique_id` column identifies the
markets, `ds` contains the datestamps, and `y` the electricity price.
For future variables, we include a forecast of how much electricity will
be produced (`gen_forecast`), system load (`system_laod`), and day of
week (`week_day`). Both the electricity system demand and offer impact
the price significantly, including these variables to the model greatly
improve performance, as we demonstrate in Olivares et al. (2022).

The `futr_df` dataframe includes the information of the future exogenous
variables for the period we want to forecast (in this case, 24 hours
after the end of the train dataset `df`).

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```


```python
df = pd.read_csv('https://datasets-nixtla.s3.amazonaws.com/EPF_FR_BE.csv')
df['ds'] = pd.to_datetime(df['ds'])

futr_df = pd.read_csv('https://datasets-nixtla.s3.amazonaws.com/EPF_FR_BE_futr.csv')
futr_df['ds'] = pd.to_datetime(futr_df['ds'])

df.head()
```

|     | unique_id | ds                  | y     | gen_forecast | system_load | week_day |
|-----|-----------|---------------------|-------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| 0   | FR        | 2015-01-01 00:00:00 | 53.48 | 76905.0      | 74812.0     | 3        |
| 1   | FR        | 2015-01-01 01:00:00 | 51.93 | 75492.0      | 71469.0     | 3        |
| 2   | FR        | 2015-01-01 02:00:00 | 48.76 | 74394.0      | 69642.0     | 3        |
| 3   | FR        | 2015-01-01 03:00:00 | 42.27 | 72639.0      | 66704.0     | 3        |
| 4   | FR        | 2015-01-01 04:00:00 | 38.41 | 69347.0      | 65051.0     | 3        |

We can see that `y` and the exogenous variables are on largely different
scales. Next, we show two methods to scale the data.

## 3. Time Series Scaling with `Neuralforecast` class

One of the most widely used approches for scaling time series is to
treat it as a pre-processing step, where each time series and temporal
exogenous variables are scaled based on their entire information in the
train set. Models are then trained on the scaled data.

To simplify pipelines, we added a scaling functionality to the
`Neuralforecast` class. Each time series will be scaled before training
the model with either `fit` or `cross_validation`, and scaling
statistics are stored. The class then uses the stored statistics to
scale the forecasts back to the original scale before returning the
forecasts.

### 3.a. Instantiate model and `Neuralforecast` class

In this example we will use the
[`TimesNet`](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/neuralforecast/models.timesnet.html#timesnet)
model, recently proposed in [Wu, Haixu, et
al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02186). First instantiate the
model with the desired parameters.

```python
from neuralforecast.models import TimesNet
from neuralforecast.core import NeuralForecast

import logging
logging.getLogger("pytorch_lightning").setLevel(logging.WARNING)
```


```python
horizon = 24 # day-ahead daily forecast
model = TimesNet(h = horizon,                                                 # Horizon
                 input_size = 5*horizon,                                      # Length of input window
                 max_steps = 100,                                             # Training iterations
                 top_k = 3,                                                   # Number of periods (for FFT).
                 num_kernels = 3,                                             # Number of kernels for Inception module
                 batch_size = 2,                                              # Number of time series per batch
                 windows_batch_size = 32,                                     # Number of windows per batch
                 learning_rate = 0.001,                                       # Learning rate
                 futr_exog_list = ['gen_forecast', 'system_load','week_day'], # Future exogenous variables
                 scaler_type = None)                                          # We use the Core scaling method
```

Fit the model by instantiating a
[`NeuralForecast`](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/neuralforecast/core.html#neuralforecast)
object and using the `fit` method. The `local_scaler_type` parameter is
used to specify the type of scaling to be used. In this case, we will
use `standard`, which scales the data to have zero mean and unit
variance.Other supported scalers are `minmax`, `robust`, `robust-iqr`,
`minmax`, and `boxcox`.

```python
nf = NeuralForecast(models=[model], freq='H', local_scaler_type='standard')
nf.fit(df=df)
```

```

### 3.b Forecast and plots

Finally, use the `predict` method to forecast the day-ahead prices. The
`Neuralforecast` class handles the inverse normalization, forecasts are
returned in the original scale.

```python
Y_hat_df = nf.predict(futr_df=futr_df)
Y_hat_df.head()
```

## 4. Temporal Window normalization during training

Temporal normalization scales each instance of the batch separately at
the window level. It is performed at each training iteration for each
window of the batch, for both target variable and temporal exogenous
covariates. For more details, see [Olivares et
al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07089) and
https://nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/common.scalers.html.

### 4.a. Instantiate model and `Neuralforecast` class

Temporal normalization is specified by the `scaler_type` argument.
Currently, it is only supported for Windows-based models
([`NHITS`](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/neuralforecast/models.nhits.html#nhits),
[`NBEATS`](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/neuralforecast/models.nbeats.html#nbeats),
[`MLP`](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/neuralforecast/models.mlp.html#mlp),
[`TimesNet`](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/neuralforecast/models.timesnet.html#timesnet),
and all Transformers). In this example, we use the
[`TimesNet`](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/neuralforecast/models.timesnet.html#timesnet)
model and `robust` scaler, recently proposed by Wu, Haixu, et
al. (2022). First instantiate the model with the desired parameters.

Visit https://nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/common.scalers.html for a
complete list of supported scalers.

```python
horizon = 24 # day-ahead daily forecast
model = TimesNet(h = horizon,                                                 # Horizon
                 input_size = 5*horizon,                                      # Length of input window
                 max_steps = 100,                                             # Training iterations
                 top_k = 3,                                                   # Number of periods (for FFT).
                 num_kernels = 3,                                             # Number of kernels for Inception module
                 batch_size = 2,                                              # Number of time series per batch
                 windows_batch_size = 32,                                     # Number of windows per batch
                 learning_rate = 0.001,                                       # Learning rate
                 futr_exog_list = ['gen_forecast', 'system_load','week_day'], # Future exogenous variables
                 scaler_type = 'robust')                                      # Robust scaling
```

Fit the model by instantiating a
[`NeuralForecast`](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/neuralforecast/core.html#neuralforecast)
object and using the `fit` method. Note that `local_scaler_type` has
`None` as default to avoid scaling the data before training.

```python
nf = NeuralForecast(models=[model], freq='H')
nf.fit(df=df)
```

```

### 4.b Forecast and plots

Finally, use the `predict` method to forecast the day-ahead prices. The
forecasts are returned in the original scale.
