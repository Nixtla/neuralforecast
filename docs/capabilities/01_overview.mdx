1.  **Model**: The model name.
2.  **AutoModel**: NeuralForecast offers most models also in an Auto\*
    version, in which the hyperparameters of the underlying model are
    automatically optimized and the best-performing model for a
    validation set is selected. The optimization methods include grid
    search, random search, and Bayesian optimization.
3.  **Family**: The main neural network architecture underpinning the
    model.
4.  **Univariate / Multivariate**: A multivariate model explicitly
    models the interactions between multiple time series in a dataset
    and will provide predictions for multiple time series concurrently.
    In contrast, a univariate model trained on multiple time series
    implicitly models interactions between multiple time series and
    provides predictions for single time series concurrently.
    Multivariate models are typically computationally expensive and
    empirically do not necessarily offer better forecasting performance
    compared to using a univariate model.
5.  **Forecast Type**: Direct forecast models are models that produce
    all steps in the forecast horizon at once. In contrast, recursive
    forecast models predict one-step ahead, and subsequently use the
    prediction to compute the next step in the forecast horizon, and so
    forth. Direct forecast models typically suffer less from bias and
    variance propagation as compared to recursive forecast models,
    whereas recursive models can be computationally less expensive.
6.  **Exogenous**: Whether the model accepts exogenous variables. This
    can be exogenous variables that contain information about the past
    and future (F), about the past only (*historical*, H), or that
    contain static information (*static*, S).
7.  **HINT** is a modular framework that can combine any type of neural
    architecture with task-specialized mixture probability and advanced
    hierarchical reconciliation strategies.
8.  Models that can produce forecasts recursively and direct. For
    example, the RNN model uses an RNN to encode the past sequence, and
    subsequently the user can choose between producing forecasts
    recursively using the RNN or direct using an MLP that uses the
    encoded sequence as input. The models feature an `recursive=False`
    feature that sets how they produce forecasts.
