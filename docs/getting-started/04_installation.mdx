> Install NeuralForecast with pip or conda

You can install the *released version* of `NeuralForecast` from the
[Python package index](https://pypi.org) with:

```shell
pip install neuralforecast
```

or

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge neuralforecast
```

> **Tip**
>
> Neural Forecasting methods profit from using GPU computation. Be sure
> to have Cuda installed.

> **Warning**
>
> We are constantly updating neuralforecast, so we suggest fixing the
> version to avoid issues. `pip install neuralforecast=="1.0.0"`

> **Tip**
>
> We recommend installing your libraries inside a python virtual or
> [conda
> environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/macos.html).

## Extras

You can use the following extras to add optional functionality:

-   distributed training with spark: `pip install neuralforecast[spark]`
-   saving and loading from S3: `pip install neuralforecast[aws]`

#### User our env (optional)

If you don’t have a Conda environment and need tools like Numba, Pandas,
NumPy, Jupyter, Tune, and Nbdev you can use ours by following these
steps:

1.  Clone the NeuralForecast repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Nixtla/neuralforecast.git && cd neuralforecast
```

1.  Create the environment using [astral’s
    uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

```bash
$ pip install uv
$ uv venv --python 3.10

```

1.  Activate the environment:

-   On Linux/MacOS:

```bash
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

-   On Windows:

```bash
$ .\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

1.  Install NeuralForecast Dev

```bash
$ uv pip install -e ".[dev]" --torch-backend cpu # for cpu backend
$ uv pip install -e ".[dev]" --torch-backend cu118 # for CUDA 11.8 PyTorch backend
```
