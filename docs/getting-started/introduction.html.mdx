  **NeuralForecast** offers a large collection of neural forecasting models
  focused on their usability, and robustness. The models range from classic
  networks like `MLP`, `RNN`s to novel proven contributions like `NBEATS`,
  `NHITS`, `TFT` and other architectures.

## Why?

There is a shared belief in Neural forecasting methods‚Äô capacity to
improve our pipeline‚Äôs accuracy and efficiency.

Unfortunately, available implementations and published research are yet
to realize neural networks‚Äô potential. They are hard to use and
continuously fail to improve over statistical methods while being
computationally prohibitive. For this reason, we created
[`NeuralForecast`](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/neuralforecast/core.html#neuralforecast),
a library favoring proven accurate and efficient models focusing on
their usability.

## üíª Installation

### PyPI

You can install
[`NeuralForecast`](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/neuralforecast/core.html#neuralforecast)‚Äôs
*released version* from the Python package index
[pip](https://pypi.org/project/neuralforecast/) with:

```python
pip install neuralforecast
```

(Installing inside a python virtualenvironment or a conda environment is
recommended.)

### Conda

Also you can install
[`NeuralForecast`](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/neuralforecast/core.html#neuralforecast)‚Äôs
*released version* from
[conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/neuralforecast) with:

```python
conda install -c conda-forge neuralforecast
```

(Installing inside a python virtualenvironment or a conda environment is
recommended.)

### Dev Mode

If you want to make some modifications to the code and see the effects
in real time (without reinstalling), follow the steps below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nixtla/neuralforecast.git
cd neuralforecast

```

## How to Use

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display, Markdown

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from neuralforecast import NeuralForecast
from neuralforecast.models import NBEATS, NHITS
from neuralforecast.utils import AirPassengersDF

# Split data and declare panel dataset
Y_df = AirPassengersDF
Y_train_df = Y_df[Y_df.ds<='1959-12-31'] # 132 train
Y_test_df = Y_df[Y_df.ds>'1959-12-31'] # 12 test

# Fit and predict with NBEATS and NHITS models
horizon = len(Y_test_df)
models = [NBEATS(input_size=2 * horizon, h=horizon, max_steps=50),
          NHITS(input_size=2 * horizon, h=horizon, max_steps=50)]
nf = NeuralForecast(models=models, freq='M')
nf.fit(df=Y_train_df)
Y_hat_df = nf.predict().reset_index()

# Plot predictions
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize = (20, 7))
Y_hat_df = Y_test_df.merge(Y_hat_df, how='left', on=['unique_id', 'ds'])
plot_df = pd.concat([Y_train_df, Y_hat_df]).set_index('ds')

plot_df[['y', 'NBEATS', 'NHITS']].plot(ax=ax, linewidth=2)

ax.set_title('AirPassengers Forecast', fontsize=22)
ax.set_ylabel('Monthly Passengers', fontsize=20)
ax.set_xlabel('Timestamp [t]', fontsize=20)
ax.legend(prop={'size': 15})
ax.grid()
```
