    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The library contains **three** types of base models: `BaseWindows`, `BaseRecurrent`, and `BaseMultivariate`. In this tutorial, we will focus on the `BaseWindows` class, which is the most common type of model in the library, with models such as `NBEATS`, `NHITS`, `TFT`, and `PatchTST`. The main difference between the three types is the sampling procedure and input batch for the `forward` method, which determines the type of model. \n",

    ":::{.callout-important}\n",

    "If you want to add a `BaseRecurrent` or `BaseMultivariate` model, please add an issue in our github.\n",

    "\n",
    "### a. Sampling process\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, the base class receives a sample of time series of the dataset from the `TimeSeriesLoader` module. The `BaseWindows` models will sample individual windows of size `input_size+h`, starting from random timestamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. `BaseWindows`' hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Get familiar with the hyperparameters specified in the base class, including `h` (horizon), `input_size`, and optimization hyperparameters such as `learning_rate`, `max_steps`, among others. The following list presents the hyperparameters related to the sampling of windows:\n",
    " \n",
    " * `h` (h): number of future values to predict.\n",
    " * `input_size` (L): number of historic values to use as input for the model.\n",
    " * `batch_size` (bs): number of time series sampled by the loader during training.\n",
    " * `valid_batch_size` (v_bs): number of time series sampled by the loader during inference (validation and test).\n",
    " * `windows_batch_size` (w_bs): number of individual windows sampled during training (from the previous time series) to form the batch.\n",
    " * `inference_windows_batch_size` (i_bs): number of individual windows sampled during inference to form each batch. Used to control the GPU memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### c. Input and Output batch shapes\n",
    "\n",
    "The `forward` method receives a batch of data in a dictionary with the following keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `insample_y`: historic values of the time series.\n",
    "- `insample_mask`: mask indicating the available values of the time series (1 if available, 0 if missing).\n",
    "- `futr_exog`: future exogenous covariates (if any).\n",
    "- `hist_exog`: historic exogenous covariates (if any).\n",

You can change the default values later at any time.\n",

    "The `reshape` method at the end of the `forward` step is used to adjust the output shape. The `loss` class contains an `outputsize_multiplier` attribute to automatically adjust the output size of the forecast depending on the `loss`. For example, for the Multi-quantile loss (`MQLoss`), the model needs to output each quantile for each horizon.\n",

    "**Finally, always include `y_pred = self.loss.domain_map(y_pred)` at the end of the `forward`**. This is necessary to map the output to the domain (and shape) of the loss function. For example, if the loss function is the `MAE`, it maps the output of shape `(batch_size, h, 1)` to `(batch_size, h)`.\n",
