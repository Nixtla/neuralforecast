    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### a. Sampling process\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, the base class receives a sample of time series of the dataset from the `TimeSeriesLoader` module. The `BaseModel` models will sample individual windows of size `input_size+h`, starting from random timestamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. `BaseModel`' hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Get familiar with the hyperparameters specified in the base class, including `h` (horizon), `input_size`, and optimization hyperparameters such as `learning_rate`, `max_steps`, among others. The following list presents the hyperparameters related to the sampling of windows:\n",
    " \n",
    " * `h` (h): number of future values to predict.\n",
    " * `input_size` (L): number of historic values to use as input for the model.\n",
    " * `batch_size` (bs): number of time series sampled by the loader during training.\n",
    " * `valid_batch_size` (v_bs): number of time series sampled by the loader during inference (validation and test).\n",
    " * `windows_batch_size` (w_bs): number of individual windows sampled during training (from the previous time series) to form the batch.\n",
    " * `inference_windows_batch_size` (i_bs): number of individual windows sampled during inference to form each batch. Used to control the GPU memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### c. Input and Output batch shapes\n",
    "\n",
    "The `forward` method receives a batch of data in a dictionary with the following keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `insample_y`: historic values of the time series.\n",
    "- `insample_mask`: mask indicating the available values of the time series (1 if available, 0 if missing).\n",
    "- `futr_exog`: future exogenous covariates (if any).\n",
    "- `hist_exog`: historic exogenous covariates (if any).\n",
    "- `stat_exog`: static exogenous covariates (if any).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following table presents the shape for each tensor if the attribute `MULTIVARIATE = False` is set:\n",

    "The `BaseModel` class contains several common methods for all windows-based models, simplifying the development of new models by preventing code duplication. The most important methods of the class are:\n",
