    "* **Probabilistic Forecasting**: Simple model adapters for quantile losses and parametric distributions.\n",
    "* **Train and Evaluation Losses** Scale-dependent, percentage and scale independent errors, and parametric likelihoods.\n",
    "* **Automatic Model Selection** Parallelized automatic hyperparameter tuning, that efficiently searches best validation configuration.\n",
    "* **Simple Interface** Unified SKLearn Interface for `StatsForecast` and `MLForecast` compatibility.\n",
    "* **Model Collection**: Out of the box implementation of `MLP`, `LSTM`, `RNN`, `TCN`, `DilatedRNN`, `NBEATS`, `NHITS`, `ESRNN`, `AutoFormer`, `Informer`, `TFT`, `VanillaTransformer`, and `StemGNN`. See the entire [collection here](https://nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/models.html)."

    "There is a shared belief in Neural forecasting methods' capacity to improve our pipeline's accuracy and efficiency.\n",

    "Unfortunately, available implementations and published research are yet to realize neural networks' potential. They are hard to use and continuously fail to improve over statistical methods while being computationally prohibitive. For this reason, we created `NeuralForecast`, a library favoring proven accurate and efficient models focusing on their usability."
