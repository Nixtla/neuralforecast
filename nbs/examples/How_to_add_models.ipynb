    "The library contains **three** types of base models: `BaseWindows`, `BaseRecurrent`, and `BaseMultivariate`. The main difference between the three types is the sampling procedure and input batch for the `forward` method, which in terms determines the type of model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. Sampling process\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, all base models receive a sample of time series of the dataset from the `TimeSeriesLoader` module. The main difference between the three types is the creation of the batch, which is then sent to the `forward` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `BaseWindows` models will sample `windows_batch_size` individual windows of size `input_size+h`. This class is designed for windows-based models, that predict the `h` future values based on a fixed short history of size `input_size`. This family of models includes the `MLP`, `NBEATS`, `NHITS`, and most unviariate Transformer based models such as `TFT` and `PatchTST`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `BaseRecurrent` models will directly use the `batch_size` time series and pass them to the model (will only use `input_size` to shorten history for truncated-backpropagation). They are designed for recurrent-based models that have infinite memory, such as `RNN`, `LSTM`, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the `BaseMultivariate` model will receive the complete set of time series from the loader. It will then sample `batch_size` timestamps, and get the windows of size `input_size+h` containing all the time series, starting at those timestamps. This base class is designed for multivariate models, such as `StemGNN`, that model the interactions between time series interactions for forecasting."
