The `neuralforecast` library provides a comprehensive set of
state-of-the-art deep learning models designed to power-up time series
forecasting pipelines.

The library is constructed using a modular approach, where different
responsibilities are isolated within specific modules. These modules
include the user interface functions (`core`), data processing and
loading (`tsdataset`), scalers, losses, and base classes for models.

This tutorial aims to explain the library’s structure and to describe
how the different modules interact with each other.

## I. Map

The following diagram presents the modules of the `neuralforecast`
library and their relations.

## II. Modules

### 1. Core (`core.py`)

The `core` module acts as the primary interaction point for users of the
`neuralforecast` library. It houses the
[`NeuralForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/core.html#neuralforecast)
class, which incorporates a range of key user interface functions
designed to simplify the process of training and forecasting models.
Functions include `fit`, `predict`, `cross_validation`, and
`predict_insample`, each one constructed to be intuitive and
user-friendly. The design of the
[`NeuralForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/core.html#neuralforecast)
class is centered around enabling users to streamline their forecasting
pipelines and to comfortably train and evaluate models.

### 2. Dataset and Loader (`tsdataset.py`)

The
[`TimeSeriesDataset`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/tsdataset.html#timeseriesdataset)
class, located within the `tsdataset` module, is responsible for the
storage and preprocessing of the input time series dataset. Once the
[`TimeSeriesDataset`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/tsdataset.html#timeseriesdataset)
class has prepared the data, it’s then consumed by the
[`TimeSeriesLoader`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/tsdataset.html#timeseriesloader)
class, which samples batches (or subsets) of the time series during the
training and inference stages.

### 3. Base Model (`common`)

The `common` module contains three `BaseModel` classes, which serve as
the foundation for all the model structures provided in the library.
These base classes allow for a level of abstraction and code-reusability
in the design of the models. We currently support three type of models:

-   `BaseWindows`: designed for window-based models like
    [`NBEATS`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/models.nbeats.html#nbeats)
    and `Transformers`.
-   `BaseRecurrent`: designed for recurrent models like
    [`RNN`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/models.rnn.html#rnn)
    and
    [`LSTM`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/models.lstm.html#lstm).
-   `BaseMultivariate`: caters to multivariate models like
    [`StemGNN`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/models.stemgnn.html#stemgnn).

### 4. Model (`models`)

The `models` module encompasses all the specific model classes available
for use in the library. These include a variety of both simple and
complex models such as
[`RNN`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/models.rnn.html#rnn),
[`NHITS`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/models.nhits.html#nhits),
[`LSTM`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/models.lstm.html#lstm),
[`StemGNN`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/models.stemgnn.html#stemgnn),
and
[`TFT`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/models.tft.html#tft).
Each model in this module extends from one of the `BaseModel` classes in
the `common` module.

### 5. Losses (`losses`)

The `losses` module includes both `numpy` and `pytorch` losses, used for
evalaution and training respectively. The module contains a wide range
of losses, including
[`MAE`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/losses.pytorch.html#mae),
[`MSE`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/losses.pytorch.html#mse),
[`MAPE`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/losses.pytorch.html#mape),
[`HuberLoss`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/losses.pytorch.html#huberloss),
among many others.

### 6. Scalers (`_scalers.py`)

The `_scalers.py` module houses the `TemporalNorm` class. This class is
responsible for the scaling (normalization) and de-scaling (reversing
the normalization) of time series data. This step is crucial because it
ensures all data fed to the model have a similar range, leading to more
stable and efficient training processes.

## III. Flow

The `user` first instantiates a model and the
[`NeuralForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/core.html#neuralforecast)
core class. When they call the `fit` method, the following flow is
executed:

1.  The `fit` method instantiates a
    [`TimeSeriesDataset`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/tsdataset.html#timeseriesdataset)
    object to store and pre-process the input time series dataset, and
    the
    [`TimeSeriesLoader`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/tsdataset.html#timeseriesloader)
    object to sample batches.
2.  The `fit` method calls the model’s `fit` method (in the `BaseModel`
    class).
3.  The model’s `fit` method instantiates a Pytorch-Lightning `Trainer`
    object, in charge of training the model.
4.  The `Trainer` method samples a batch from the
    [`TimeSeriesLoader`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/tsdataset.html#timeseriesloader)
    object, and calls the model’s `training_step` method (in the
    `BaseModel` class).
5.  The model’s `training_step`:
    -   Samples windows from the original batch.
    -   Normalizes the windows with the `scaler` module.
    -   Calls the model’s `forward` method.
    -   Computes the loss using the `losses` module.
    -   Returns the loss.
6.  The `Trainer` object repeats step 4 and 5 until `max_steps`
    iterations are completed.
7.  The model is fitted, and can be used for forecasting future values
    (with the `predict` method) or recover insample predictions (using
    the `predict_insample` method).

## IV. Next Steps: add your own model

Congratulations! You now know the internal details of the
`neuralforecast` library.

With this knowledge you can easily add new models to the library, by
just creating a `model` class which only requires the `init` and
`forward` methods.
