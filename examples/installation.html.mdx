You can install the *released version* of
[`NeuralForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/core.html#neuralforecast)
from the [Python package index](https://pypi.org) with:

```python
pip install neuralforecast
```

or

```python
conda install -c conda-forge neuralforecast
```

<Tip>

Neural Forecasting methods profit from using GPU computation. Be sure to
have Cuda installed.

</Tip>

<Warning>

We are constantly updating neuralforecast, so we suggest fixing the
version to avoid issues. `pip install neuralforecast=="1.0.0"`

</Warning>

<Tip>

We recommend installing your libraries inside a python virtual or [conda
environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/macos.html).

```

1.  Create the environment using the `environment.yml` file:
