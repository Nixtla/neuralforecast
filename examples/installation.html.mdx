You can install the *released version* of
[`NeuralForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/core.html#neuralforecast)
from the [Python package index](https://pypi.org) with:

```shell
pip install neuralforecast
```

or

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge neuralforecast
```

> **Tip**
>
> Neural Forecasting methods profit from using GPU computation. Be sure
> to have Cuda installed.

> **Warning**
>
> We are constantly updating neuralforecast, so we suggest fixing the
> version to avoid issues. `pip install neuralforecast=="1.0.0"`

> **Tip**
>
> We recommend installing your libraries inside a python virtual or
> [conda
> environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/macos.html).
