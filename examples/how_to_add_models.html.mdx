## Introduction

This tutorial is aimed at contributors who want to add a new model to
the NeuralForecast library. The library’s existing modules handle
optimization, training, selection, and evaluation of deep learning
models. The `core` class simplifies building entire pipelines, both for
industry and academia, on any dataset, with user-friendly methods such
as `fit` and `predict`.

Adding a new model to NeuralForecast is simpler than building a new
PyTorch model from scratch. You only need to write the forward method.

**It has the following additional advantages:**

-   Existing modules in NeuralForecast already implement the essential
    training and evaluating aspects for deep learning models.
-   Integrated with PyTorch-Lightning and Tune libraries for efficient
    optimization and distributed computation.
-   The `BaseModel` classes provide common optimization components, such
    as early stopping and learning rate schedulers.
-   Automatic performance tests are scheduled on Github to ensure
    quality standards.
-   Users can easily compare the performance and computation of the new
    model with existing models.
-   Opportunity for exposure to a large community of users and
    contributors.

### Example: simplified MLP model

We will present the tutorial following an example on how to add a
simplified version of the current
[`MLP`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/models.mlp.html#mlp)
model, which does not include exogenous covariates.

At a given timestamp $t$, the
[`MLP`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/models.mlp.html#mlp)
model will forecast the next $h$ values of the univariate target time,
$Y_{t+1:t+h}$, using as inputs the last $L$ historical values, given by
$Y_{t-L:t}$. The following figure presents a diagram of the model.

## 0. Preliminaries

Follow our tutorial on contributing
[here](https://github.com/Nixtla/neuralforecast/blob/main/contributing.md)
to set up your development environment.

Here is a short list of the most important steps:

1.  Create a fork of the `neuralforecast` library.
2.  Clone the fork to your computer.
3.  Set an environment with the `neuralforecast` library, core
    dependencies, and `nbdev` package to code your model in an
    interactive notebook.

## 1. Inherit the Base Class (`BaseWindows`)

The library contains **three** types of base models: `BaseWindows`,
`BaseRecurrent`, and `BaseMultivariate`. In this tutorial, we will focus
on the `BaseWindows` class, which is the most common type of model in
the library, with models such as
[`NBEATS`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/models.nbeats.html#nbeats),
[`NHITS`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/models.nhits.html#nhits),
[`TFT`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/models.tft.html#tft),
and
[`PatchTST`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/models.patchtst.html#patchtst).
The main difference between the three types is the sampling procedure
and input batch for the `forward` method, which determines the type of
model.

> **Important**
>
> If you want to add a `BaseRecurrent` or `BaseMultivariate` model,
> please add an issue in our github.

### a. Sampling process

During training, the base class receives a sample of time series of the
dataset from the
[`TimeSeriesLoader`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/tsdataset.html#timeseriesloader)
module. The `BaseWindows` models will sample individual windows of size
`input_size+h`, starting from random timestamps.

### b. `BaseWindows`’ hyperparameters

Get familiar with the hyperparameters specified in the base class,
including `h` (horizon), `input_size`, and optimization hyperparameters
such as `learning_rate`, `max_steps`, among others. The following list
presents the hyperparameters related to the sampling of windows:

-   `h` (h): number of future values to predict.
-   `input_size` (L): number of historic values to use as input for the
    model.
-   `batch_size` (bs): number of time series sampled by the loader
    during training.
-   `valid_batch_size` (v_bs): number of time series sampled by the
    loader during inference (validation and test).
-   `windows_batch_size` (w_bs): number of individual windows sampled
    during training (from the previous time series) to form the batch.
-   `inference_windows_batch_size` (i_bs): number of individual windows
    sampled during inference to form each batch. Used to control the GPU
    memory.

### c. Input and Output batch shapes

The `forward` method receives a batch of data in a dictionary with the
following keys:

-   `insample_y`: historic values of the time series.
-   `insample_mask`: mask indicating the available values of the time
    series (1 if available, 0 if missing).
-   `futr_exog`: future exogenous covariates (if any).
-   `hist_exog`: historic exogenous covariates (if any).
-   `stat_exog`: static exogenous covariates (if any).

The following table presents the shape for each tensor:

| `tensor`        | `BaseWindows`            |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| `insample_y`    | (`w_bs`, `L`)            |
| `insample_mask` | (`w_bs`, `L`)            |
| `futr_exog`     | (`w_bs`, `L`+`h`, `n_f`) |
| `hist_exog`     | (`w_bs`, `L`, `n_h`)     |
| `stat_exog`     | (`w_bs`,`n_s`)           |

The `forward` function should return a single tensor with the forecasts
of the next `h` timestamps for each window. Use the attributes of the
`loss` class to automatically parse the output to the correct shape (see
the example below).

> **Tip**
>
> Since we are using `nbdev`, you can easily add prints to the code and
> see the shapes of the tensors during training.

### d. `BaseWindows`’ methods

The `BaseWindows` class contains several common methods for all
windows-based models, simplifying the development of new models by
preventing code duplication. The most important methods of the class
are:

-   `_create_windows`: parses the time series from the
    [`TimeSeriesLoader`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/tsdataset.html#timeseriesloader)
    into individual windows of size `input_size+h`.
-   `_normalization`: normalizes each window based on the `scaler` type.
-   `_inv_normalization`: inverse normalization of the forecasts.
-   `training_step`: training step of the model, called by
    PyTorch-Lightning’s `Trainer` class during training (`fit` method).
-   `validation_step`: validation step of the model, called by
    PyTorch-Lightning’s `Trainer` class during validation.
-   `predict_step`: prediction step of the model, called by
    PyTorch-Lightning’s `Trainer` class during inference (`predict`
    method).

## 2. Create the model file and class

Once familiar with the basics of the `BaseWindows` class, the next step
is creating your particular model.

The main steps are:

1.  Create the file in the `nbs` folder
    (https://github.com/Nixtla/neuralforecast/tree/main/nbs). It should
    be named `models.YOUR_MODEL_NAME.ipynb`.
2.  Add the header of the `nbdev` file.
3.  Import libraries in the file.
4.  Define the `__init__` method with the model’s inherited and
    particular hyperparameters and instantiate the architecture.
5.  Define the `forward` method, which recieves the input batch
    dictionary and returns the forecast.

### a. Model class

First, add the following **two cells** on top of the `nbdev` file.

```python
#| default_exp models.mlp
```

> **Important**
>
> Change `mlp` to your model’s name, using lowercase and underscores.
> When you later run `nbdev_export`, it will create a `YOUR_MODEL.py`
> script in the `neuralforecast/models/` directory.

```python
#| hide
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
```

Next, add the dependencies of the model.

```python
#| export
from typing import Optional

import torch
import torch.nn as nn

from neuralforecast.losses.pytorch import MAE
from neuralforecast.common._base_windows import BaseWindows
```

> **Tip**
>
> Don’t forget to add the `#| export` tag on this cell.

Next, create the class with the `init` and `forward` methods. The
following example shows the example for the simplified
[`MLP`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/models.mlp.html#mlp)
model. We explain important details after the code.

```python
#| export
class MLP(BaseWindows): # <<---- Inherits from BaseWindows
    def __init__(self,
                 # Inhereted hyperparameters with no defaults
                 h,
                 input_size,
                 # Model specific hyperparameters
                 num_layers = 2,
                 hidden_size = 1024,
                 # Inhereted hyperparameters with defaults
                 exclude_insample_y = False,
                 loss = MAE(),
                 valid_loss = None,
                 max_steps: int = 1000,
                 learning_rate: float = 1e-3,
                 num_lr_decays: int = -1,
                 early_stop_patience_steps: int =-1,
                 val_check_steps: int = 100,
                 batch_size: int = 32,
                 valid_batch_size: Optional[int] = None,
                 windows_batch_size = 1024,
                 inference_windows_batch_size = -1,
                 step_size: int = 1,
                 scaler_type: str = 'identity',
                 random_seed: int = 1,
                 num_workers_loader: int = 0,
                 drop_last_loader: bool = False,
                 **trainer_kwargs):
    # Inherit BaseWindows class
    super(MLP, self).__init__(h=h,
                              input_size=input_size,
                              ..., # <<--- Add all inhereted hyperparameters
                              random_seed=random_seed,
                              **trainer_kwargs)

    # Architecture
    self.num_layers = num_layers
    self.hidden_size = hidden_size

    # MultiLayer Perceptron
    layers = [nn.Linear(in_features=input_size, out_features=hidden_size)]
    layers += [nn.ReLU()]
    for i in range(num_layers - 1):
        layers += [nn.Linear(in_features=hidden_size, out_features=hidden_size)]
        layers += [nn.ReLU()]
    self.mlp = nn.ModuleList(layers)

    # Adapter with Loss dependent dimensions
    self.out = nn.Linear(in_features=hidden_size, 
                         out_features=h * self.loss.outputsize_multiplier) ## <<--- Use outputsize_multiplier to adjust output size

    def forward(self, windows_batch): # <<--- Receives windows_batch dictionary
        # Parse windows_batch
        insample_y = windows_batch['insample_y'].clone()
        # MLP
        y_pred = self.mlp(y_pred)
        # Reshape and map to loss domain
        y_pred = y_pred.reshape(batch_size, self.h, self.loss.outputsize_multiplier)
        y_pred = self.loss.domain_map(y_pred)
        return y_pred

```

> -   Larger architectures, such as Transformers, might require
>     splitting the `forward` by using intermediate functions.

#### Important notes

The base class has many hyperparameters, and models must have default
values for all of them (except `h` and `input_size`). If you are unsure
of what default value to use, we recommend copying the default values
from existing models for most optimization and sampling hyperparameters.
You can change the default values later at any time.

The `reshape` method at the end of the `forward` step is used to adjust
the output shape. The `loss` class contains an `outputsize_multiplier`
attribute to automatically adjust the output size of the forecast
depending on the `loss`. For example, for the Multi-quantile loss
([`MQLoss`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/losses.pytorch.html#mqloss)),
the model needs to output each quantile for each horizon.

**Finally, always include `y_pred = self.loss.domain_map(y_pred)` at the
end of the `forward`**. This is necessary to map the output to the
domain (and shape) of the loss function. For example, if the loss
function is the
[`MAE`](https://Nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/losses.pytorch.html#mae),
it maps the output of shape `(batch_size, h, 1)` to `(batch_size, h)`.

### b. Tests and documentation

`nbdev` allows for testing and documenting the model during the
development process. It allows users to iterate the development within
the notebook, testing the code in the same environment. Refer to
existing models, such as the complete MLP model
[here](https://github.com/Nixtla/neuralforecast/blob/main/nbs/models.mlp.html).
These files already contain the tests, documentation, and usage examples
that were used during the development process.

### c. Export the new model to the library with `nbdev`

Following the CONTRIBUTING guide, the next step is to export the new
model from the development notebook to the `neuralforecast` folder with
the actual scripts.

To export the model, run `nbdev_export` in your terminal. You should see
a new file with your model in the `neuralforecast/models/` folder.

## 3. Core class and additional files

Finally, add the model to the `core` class and additional files:

1.  Manually add the model in the following [init
    file](https://github.com/Nixtla/neuralforecast/blob/main/neuralforecast/models/__init__.py).

2.  Add the model to the `core` class, using the `nbdev` file
    [here](https://github.com/Nixtla/neuralforecast/blob/main/nbs/core.html):

    1.  Add the model to the initial model list:

    ```python
    from neuralforecast.models import (
    GRU, LSTM, RNN, TCN, DilatedRNN,
    MLP, NHITS, NBEATS, NBEATSx,
    TFT, VanillaTransformer,
    Informer, Autoformer, FEDformer,
    StemGNN, PatchTST
    )
    ```

    1.  Add the model to the `MODEL_FILENAME_DICT` dictionary (used for
        the `save` and `load` functions).

## 4. Upload to GitHub

Congratulations! The model is ready to be used in the library following
the steps above.

Follow our contributing guide’s final steps to upload the model to
GitHub:
