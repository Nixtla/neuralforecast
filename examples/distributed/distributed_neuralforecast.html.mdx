## Data

```python
df = pd.read_parquet('https://datasets-nixtla.s3.amazonaws.com/m4-hourly.parquet')
df['exog_0'] = np.random.rand(df.shape[0])
static = df.groupby('unique_id').head(1)
static['stat_0'] = static['unique_id'].astype('category').cat.codes
static = static[['unique_id', 'stat_0']]
valid = df.groupby('unique_id').tail(24)
train = df.drop(valid.index)
# save for loading in spark
s3_prefix = 's3://nixtla-tmp/distributed'
train.to_parquet(f'{s3_prefix}/train.parquet', index=False)
valid.to_parquet(f'{s3_prefix}/valid.parquet', index=False)
static.to_parquet(f'{s3_prefix}/static.parquet', index=False)
# load in spark
spark_train = spark.read.parquet(f'{s3_prefix}/train.parquet')
spark_valid = spark.read.parquet(f'{s3_prefix}/valid.parquet')
spark_static = spark.read.parquet(f'{s3_prefix}/static.parquet')
```

## Configuration

```python
# Configuration required for distributed training
dist_cfg = DistributedConfig(
    partitions_path=f'{s3_prefix}/partitions',  # path where the partitions will be saved
    num_nodes=2,  # number of nodes to use during training (machines)
    devices=1,   # number of GPUs in each machine
)

# pytorch lightning configuration
# the executors don't have permission to write on the filesystem, so we disable saving artifacts
distributed_kwargs = dict(
    accelerator='gpu',
    enable_progress_bar=False,
    logger=False,
    enable_checkpointing=False,
)

# exogenous features
exogs = {
    'futr_exog_list': ['exog_0'],
    'stat_exog_list': ['stat_0'],
}

# for the AutoNHITS
def config(trial):
    return dict(
        input_size=48,
        max_steps=2_000,
        learning_rate=trial.suggest_loguniform('learning_rate', 1e-4, 1e-1),
        **exogs,
        **distributed_kwargs
    )
```

## Model training

```python
nf = NeuralForecast(
    models=[
        NHITS(h=24, input_size=48, max_steps=2_000, **exogs, **distributed_kwargs),
        AutoNHITS(h=24, config=config, backend='optuna', num_samples=2, alias='tuned_nhits'),
        LSTM(h=24, input_size=48, max_steps=2_000, **exogs, **distributed_kwargs),
    ],
    freq=1,
)
nf.fit(spark_train, static_df=spark_static, distributed_config=dist_cfg, val_size=24)
```

## Forecasting

When weâ€™re done training the model in a distributed way we can predict
using the stored dataset. If we have future exogenous features we can
provide a spark dataframe as `futr_df`. Note that if you want to load
the stored dataset you need to provide the spark session through the
`engine` argument.

```python
saved_ds_preds = nf.predict(futr_df=spark_valid.drop("y"), engine=spark).toPandas()
```

We can also provide a spark dataframe as `df` as well as `static_df` and
`futr_df` (if applicable) to compute predictions on different data or
after loading a saved model.

```python
new_df_preds = nf.predict(df=spark_train, static_df=spark_static, futr_df=spark_valid.drop("y")).toPandas()
```

Either of the above methods will yield the same results.

```python
pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(
    saved_ds_preds.sort_values(['unique_id', 'ds']).reset_index(drop=True),
    new_df_preds.sort_values(['unique_id', 'ds']).reset_index(drop=True),
    atol=1e-3,
)
```

## Saving for inference

We can now persist the trained models

```python
save_path = f'{s3_prefix}/model-artifacts'
nf.save(save_path, save_dataset=False, overwrite=True)
```

And load them back

```python
nf2 = NeuralForecast.load(save_path)
```

``` text
[rank: 0] Seed set to 1
[rank: 0] Seed set to 1
[rank: 0] Seed set to 1
```

We can now use this object to compute forecasts. We can provide either
local dataframes (pandas, polars) as well as spark dataframes

```python
preds = nf.predict(df=train, static_df=static, futr_df=valid.drop(columns='y'))
preds2 = nf2.predict(df=train, static_df=static, futr_df=valid.drop(columns='y'))[preds.columns]
pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(saved_ds_preds, preds)
pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(preds, preds2)
```

## Evaluation

```python
(
    evaluate(
        preds.merge(valid.drop(columns='exog_0'), on=['unique_id', 'ds']),
        metrics=[mae, rmse, smape],
    )
    .drop(columns='unique_id')
    .groupby('metric')
    .mean()
)
```

|--------|------------|-------------|------------|
